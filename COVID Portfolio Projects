  ## Using CTE For RollingPeopleVaccinated vs Population

WITH

  WHERE
    Death.continent IS NOT NULL)
SELECT
  *,

 ## Using Temp Table to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query

DROP Table if exists Covid.PercentPopulationVaccinated
Create Table Covid.PercentPopulationVaccinated
(
Continent nvarchar(255),
Location nvarchar(255),
Date datetime,
Population numeric,
New_vaccinations numeric,
RollingPeopleVaccinated numeric
)

Insert into Covid.PercentPopulationVaccinate
(
Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
, SUM(CONVERT(int,vac.new_vaccinations)) OVER (Partition by dea.Location Order by dea.location, dea.Date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated

From  `portfol-1-378507.Covid.Covid_deaths` AS dea
Join `portfol-1-378507.Covid.Covid_vaccination` AS  vac
	On dea.location = vac.location
	and dea.date = vac.date
  )

Select *, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/Population)*100
From Covid.PercentPopulationVaccinated


## Creating View to store data for later visualizations

Create View Covid.PercentPopulationVaccinated as
Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
 ,SUM(vac.new_vaccinations) OVER (Partition by dea.location Order by dea.location, dea.date) as RollingPeopleVaccinated
From  `portfol-1-378507.Covid.Covid_deaths` AS dea
Join `portfol-1-378507.Covid.Covid_vaccination` AS vac
	On dea.location = vac.location
	and dea.date = vac.date
where dea.continent is not null
